            <h4> Sandwich Fixings: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
                <li> 2 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
                <li> ½ cup chicken stock </li>
                <li> 12 ounces fresh spinach </li>
                <li> 1 medium lemon, juiced </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
                <li> 1 cup shredded Manchego cheese </li>
                <li> 4 crusty rolls </li>
            </ul>

        <h3> Directions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Make the pork: Remove the netting or strings from pork roast, keeping them intact to use again. Combine rosemary, parsley, garlic, 
                3 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper in a bowl. Slice open pork roast and spread it with herb mixture. 
                Roll up pork and secure it with the netting or string. Rub remaining 1 teaspoon oil all over pork; season with more salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Place pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan; pour in water. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally and adding more water if necessary, 
                until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat reads at least 145 degrees F 
                (63 degrees C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Reserve pan juices in the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>While the pork is resting, prepare fixings: Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and 
                stir until garlic is fragrant but not brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add spinach, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. 
                Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut and remove the string from the roast. Cut pork into thin slices. Return sliced pork to the juices in the roasting pan.</li>
            <li> Slice sandwich rolls. Sprinkle Manchego cheese over split rolls, add pork slices, and top with spinach.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Tips: </h3>
        <p> This recipe makes enough pork to fill 4 to 6 sandwiches. The traditional roast pork sandwich is made with provolone cheese. Manchego has a slightly stronger 
            flavor, which is a great complement to pork and greens. If you can't find Manchego, use provolone.</p>
